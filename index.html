    <div id="img-caption">"I could see people were going to need these things and the amount of information would increase. 
      And I still think it's going to increase even more. I don't think we've even begun to recognize how much we are 
      going to have to do with these computers. I don't think people are facing what the future is going to be like. 
      The big computers are not going to handle all the data. We'll go to systems of computers. And the sooner we begin to 
      do it the better. There's never any reason to put inventory and payroll on the same computer, but we only did it 
      because we had only one computer. There's every reason to pull those off onto separate computers and dedicate them. 
      We can simplify the software and run them in parallel, which makes things go much better."
