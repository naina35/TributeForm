            <p class="light">Grace Hopper was a pioneering American mathematician and rear admiral in the U.S. Navy, renowned for her groundbreaking work in computer technology.

            <p class="dark">
            Early Life and Education: Born in New York City, Hopper graduated from Vassar College in 1928, and earned her M.A. (1930) and Ph.D. (1934) from Yale University.
            </p>
            <p class="light">
            Military Service and Early Contributions: Hopper joined the Naval Reserve in 1943 and was assigned to the Bureau of Ordnance Computation Project at Harvard University. There, she worked on the Mark I, the first large-scale automatic calculator, and wrote the first comprehensive computer manual.
            </p>
            <p class="dark">Compiler Development: In 1949, Hopper joined Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corp., where she designed one of the first compilers and coined the term "compiler". She played a key role in developing UNIVAC I, the first commercial electronic computer.</p>
            <p class="light">COBOL and Legacy: Hopper's work on Flow-Matic led to the development of COBOL, a language that became widely used in the 1960s. Her advocacy for COBOL and development of compilers significantly influenced programming practices.
            </p>
            <p class="dark">Awards and Honors: Hopper was elected a fellow of the IEEE (1962), named Computer Science Man of the Year (1969), and awarded the National Medal of Technology (1991). Posthumously, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2016).
